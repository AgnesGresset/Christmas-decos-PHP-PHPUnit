# Cute Christmas cacophonies

---

## It is nearly summer 2020, so what we need now is Christmas vibes :)!

Have you always dreamed about being able to produce scintillating Christmas lights,
magical snow balls or nicely decorated trees in your browser or in a terminal?
Yes! I was sure you have! Your dreams will come true with this program:
Tell us what you want to automagically create and in which size you would like to see it appear in front of your eyes
and SWOOSH, they will populate your favorite Internet portal in an instant.
Happy summery Christmas!

## Console Output
You no big fan of fancy 'klicky-bunty' user interfaces? I hear you, I hear you: 
Log in to our root directory and type in the magical words: "SESAM". 
This is not going to do anything, except throw a nasty error at your nose.
Then type in the programmatic words:
```bash
 php src/Script/generate_shapes.php
```
It is going to be better than if you had found the Holy Grale. Have fun with it.

## Browser Output
You are all about nicely formatted and stylish ultra modern 3D websites?
Well this ain't one of them. Give us some info regarding your Xmas-y preferences
and the browser will produce the most basic, not-fashionable, not-colorable output ever.
But at least, you will see your beaUtifUl creations.

## Unit Tests
You do not trust the PROGRAM? I don't blame, we should never do.
Throw this order to the command line in the root directory, and at least, some stuff will be proven absolutely correct.

```bash
 vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit --colors="always" tests/
```
Yes, the earth is flat. But it is not part of these unit tests.

## On a more Sirius note - Tech used in this masterpiece:
* Composer was installed to install phpunit
* PHPUnit was installed to write Unit Tests
